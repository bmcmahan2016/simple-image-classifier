# simple-image-classifier
The goal of this project is to become more familiar with PyTorch by building a 
simple image classifier closely following the tutorial found at:
https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/blitz/cifar10_tutorial.html#sphx-glr-beginner-blitz-cifar10-tutorial-py

In addition to the code provided in the tutorial, I have added the following 
functionalities:

1.) custom loss class that allows for easy visualization of training loss

2.) Training is over 10 epochs

The training_a_classifier.py script will train the classifier on the Places365 dataset
The test_clf.py scrtipt will test an already trained and save classifier on the Places365 dataset
